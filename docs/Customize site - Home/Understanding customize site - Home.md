The home page is the first page an end-user will see when they visit your {{glossary.Knowledge Base}}. The customize site - Home lets you customize your home page by adding links, changing colors, including categories from your knowledge base, and more.

The customize site - home comes with an intuitive interface to design a professional looking front-page to your knowledge base. You do not need any developer support to create a good looking home page. 

If you do not want a home page and would like to direct the user directly to the real content, you can easily turn off the home page for your knowledge base.
